## Introduction
This document describes a collection of SwitchBot API methods, examples, and best practices for, but not limited to, IoT hobbyists, developers, and gurus to make their own smart home programs or applications. 

## Getting Started
Please follow these steps,
1. Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store
2. Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account
3. Generate an Open Token within the app
a) Go to Profile > Preference
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token
4. Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI!

## Authentication
### Open Token
The token returned from the SwitchBot Cloud is an encrypted open token that grants the user developer-level permissions. The user will be able to add, delete, edit, and look up his or her user data including profile data and data associated with the devices that have been added to the user's account.



## Glossary

The following table provides definitions to the terms to be frequently mentioned in the subsequent sections.

| Term          | Description                                                  |

| :--- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad Request            | The client has issued an invalid request. This is commonly used to specify validation errors in a request payload. |
| 401  | Unauthorized           | Authorization for the API is required, but the request has not been authenticated. |
| 403  | Forbidden              | The request has been authenticated but does not have appropriate permissions, or a requested resource is not found. |
| 404  | Not Found              | Specifies the requested path does not exist.                 |
| 406  | Not Acceptable         | The client has requested a MIME type via the Accept header for a value not supported by the server. |
| 415  | Unsupported Media Type | The client has defined a contentType header that is not supported by the server. |
| 422  | Unprocessable Entity   | The client has made a valid request, but the server cannot process it. This is often used for APIs for which certain limits have been exceeded. |
| 429  | Too Many Requests      | The client has exceeded the number of requests allowed for a given time window. |
| 500  | Internal Server Error  | An unexpected error on the SmartThings servers has occurred. These errors should be rare. |

>  Note: Most of the devices support `turnOn` or `turnOff`, which are case-sensitive. For infrared remote devices, when you have created customized buttons, you must set `commandType` to `customize`, otherwise the command will not work. `command` needs to be set to the name of the customized button.
